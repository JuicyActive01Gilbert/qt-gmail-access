omapd is an open source implementation of the IF-MAP v1.1 specification
published by the Trusted Computing Group [1].

To build omapd, you will need a Qt development environment [2].  Initial
development of omapd was built against Qt v4.5.2.  Development as of
omapd-0.3.0 is using Qt v4.6.2, and minimum of Qt v4.6.0 is required because of
the QXmlStream classes.  As of omapd-0.7.0, Qt v4.8 is required because of
the QSsl::SecureProtocols constant, which makes it much easier to disable
SSLv2.

1. Change directory into the plugins/RAMHashTables directory, 
   run qmake and make.
2. Run qmake on the omapd.pro file, then run make.
3. Create a server certificate, or use the certgen.sh script
4. Run omapd
